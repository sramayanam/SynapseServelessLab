### Labs accompany notebooks and therefore spark pool is needed
### Labs should be executed on the ondemand pools and therefore no need of dedicated synapse pools

### The learner utilizes the sample datasets in the LabFiles folder and the scripts in LabScripts to learn the following items
- Learn to query the Jsonl files to parse nested structures and fetch the elements in the relational format applying various business rules

- Learn to query the multiple parquet files and parse the attributes such as Year-Month which could be filtered in the views

- Learn to ingest MasterData organized as CSV files

- Learn to create Virtual data lake on top of storage with external fact and dimensions with business rules implemented in views

- Learn to implement Statistics on top of tables created in the database

- Learn to utilize the synapse spark to load operational data to a CosmosDB container

- Learn to create the spark tables in the lake database

- Utilize a linked service to perform analytics on the synapse link enabled containers from cosmosDB

- Learn to read the data shared through lakedb and run on-demand queries on the lake database

#### *All the datasets other than Azure opendatasets are provided as part of the lab
